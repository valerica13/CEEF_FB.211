      <p>Hello my sweet girl. This is your reminder that I love you sososososososo much. I miss you so much but only 25 days left. 3 weeks and 4 days  So little left and it will be less than 3 weeks and then less than 2 and you'll blink and wake up in my arms every day for the rest of our lives.  </p>
      <p>Today I remembered all of our favourite cat memes. Larry, James, "i want a stove, a TV, a wachin machin", "raise your hanntttt" and I miss us sending each other cute cats being like "this is us". It feels like an eternity has passed and I took it for granted...never thought we'd ever have more important things to worry about than cat memes and McDonald's orders. 
I will never take you for granted again, I'll cherish every second I get with you. I will kiss the ground you walk on. I just need you.  </p>
      <p> One year ago today we had our first pinic, in the park, with tiramisu. Good times huh? Well, many more to come soon.</p>
      <p>I hope elisa is on our side, please be careful about her. I've been thinking about it since you told me she saw we were texting. Let me know how sure you are it's safe she knows.</p>
      <p>I hope you have a great day. Stay calm, everything is under control. Nobody can harm you, or me. (I talked to my father about those accusations and he said its bullshit and intimidation). Conversion therapy or whatever they're trying to do rn won't work and your favourite movie is literally "But im a cheerleader" so that is ironic. Remember baby, "One, two three four, you're the one that i adore. Five, six seven, eight, don't run from me cause this is fate" </p>
      <p>Please every step you make and every breath you take, know that I am with you and you're in my heart. I hope you can feel my presence even if im far away. I love you endlessly. Take care of yourself for I can't do it for you now. I can't wait until we meet again.
 </p>
