      <p> hello babi. daily reminder that i love you so much. i'll try to update this site every day so that you can open it whenever you can and read some encouragement words. 
      i'm sorry i said "don't email me so often", i just want you to know how much i want endless texts from you but we have only 26 days left and we cannot risk anything right now or it will not be pretty at all. we have to be strong. natalia zice "rabdati o luna, pentru o eternitate impreuna.". Nothing about my love for you can change, if anything- it grows bigger and bigger every day you're not with me.</p>
      <p> you can email me when you need to hear from me and when you need to let stuff out. but carefully do so i beg you. email it, delete it and ill reply on this website. i always see your emails i just don't want to reply in case it's not safe. it doesn't mean i don't want to talk to you. i'm scared of getting caught because if we do, you won't be able to notify me that you're in danger. </p>
      <p> i'd also appreciate just a dot, or short "i'm fine" email if you can every day(delete it right after) so that i know nothing happened or else i might freak out.</p>
      <p>Be nice to your parents please. try to keep everything calm. it matters a lot. they're good people they just don't know how to cope. let them say whatever about me or my family, don't make a huge deal out of it -it's irrelevant. i trust you, your judgement and actions.</p>
      <p>i love you. please stay strong. we all believe in you. you've been through the hardest part, now you just have to hang in there and be patient and resilient. stay safe. see you in less than 4 weeks. </p>
